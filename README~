## -----General-----

## This code is used to generate the figures displayed in
## the paper "When to vaccinate a fluctuating wildlife population: is timing everything?".
## Most directories contain a simulation script to generate
## the data, and a graphing script to produce the EPS figures.
## Some figures do not require much simulation (e.g. Figure 1), and in these
## cases the simulation and graphing are combined into a single
## script. Data that appears in figures 6 and 8 are simulated
## using C++ - see the notes section for details on how to
## simulate these. 

## Parameters for the simulations are specified in a dataframe
## called parmat. Time units are days. The parameter names are

## -----Parameter List------

## d - rate of host death from natural causes
## gamv - rate at which hosts transition from class Sv to V
## Nv - number of hosts exposed to vaccine during each campaign
## tv - the timing of annual vaccination, measured as days into the year
## tb - the duration of the birthing season
## NPeak - the peak population size, achieved once per year
## Rp - basic reproduction number of the pathogen
## Bp - transmission coefficient of the pathogen
## gamp - rate at which infected hosts transition out of infected class
## pmu - probability an infected host dies from infection (rather than recovers) 

## -----Simulation times-----

## Figure 1: < 1 minute
## Figure 2: 154 core minutes
## Figure 3: 316 cpu minutes (when 25 tb values used. Figure generated with 365 values)
## Figure 4: 137 core minutes   
## Figure 5: < 1 minute
## Figure 6: see below
## Figure 7: < 1 minute
## Figure 8: see below

## ------Notes-----

## --The birth rate "b" parameter is specified by choosing
## parameter values for NPeak, d, and tb.
